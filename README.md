## Description
JobGenie is a cutting-edge job search platform that leverages AI technology to streamline the job search process. It offers personalized job recommendations and clear rejection insights, making it easier for users to find their dream jobs. This project aims to address the inefficiencies in traditional job search processes by providing tailored solutions to job seekers' needs.

## Problem Statement
Inefficient Job Search Processes:
1. **Overwhelming Job Boards**: Sifting through endless job listings can be time-consuming and overwhelming, making it difficult for users to find the perfect fit.
2. **Impersonal Recommendations**: Generic job recommendations often miss the mark, failing to consider an individual's unique skills and career goals.
3. **Lack of Rejection Reasons**: Job seekers often encounter the frustration of not receiving clear reasons for their rejections, making it challenging for them to improve their applications and skills.
4. **Missing Out on Specific Job Role Suggestions**: Job seekers may miss out on job opportunities that align with their skills and career goals due to not receiving specific job role suggestions based on their job description.
